## Opening the project
This project requires [GameMaker Studio 2](https://www.yoyogames.com/get) in order to open and make changes to it. No liscense should be required, however that is untested.

## Creating issues
Create issues to your heart's content. They let me know what needs to be fixed and what should be tweaked or added. If enough of a community grows around this project, I will try and interact with it as best as I can.
